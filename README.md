# Quantitative Analysis

A positive customer experience increases 85% of the original growth , whereas a negative experience, may decrease 70 percent of expected growth. 
So tracking a user and its experience becomes important and getting this wrong can prove a costly exercise to any financial institution out there.

Rather than rely on assumption, how can a business know exactly what makes a service ideal for the users?
The answer lies in the deep analysis of customer sentiment. Tracking simple metrics like NPS (Net Promoter Score) is pointless if customer feedback on how to increase that metric is not strategically used to make positive change, even if there is a direct link to revenue. In this article, we reveal that customer sentiment analysis is not just about assigning a positive/negative label. Plus we explain how to deepen this analysis and benefit practically from the results.
